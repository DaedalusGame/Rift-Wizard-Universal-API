
to select the translation you'd like to play with, open the options menu. there'll be an option called 'Language'

to make a translation, make a file called something like `Japanese by yupika.txt` inside the folder `mods/API_Universal/translations`
whatever this text file is named will be used as the name of the translation in the options menu

on each line of that file, put the English text to be translated, a tab character, and then the Japanese text it translates into. Any text that hasn't been translated will be printed to that black window in the background of this screenshot. Copy/paste from that window to get a head start on a list of text that needs to be translated (much easier than typing all the english text out manually)

This should be fairly painless. Let me know if anything feels more difficult than it should
